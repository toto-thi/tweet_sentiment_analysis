This project uses machine learning to classify tweet sentiment as positive or negative. 
Two models were tested: Logistic Regression, which achieved good baseline performance, 
and BERT, which provided a slight accuracy boost but required more computational resources. 
Results highlight the trade-offs between model complexity and resource limitations in NLP tasks.
